# Wheat Kernel Analysis

## Overview
This project explores and analyzes a dataset containing information about kernels belonging to three different varieties of wheat: Kama, Rosa, and Canadian. It includes visualization of scatterplots, clustering using K-means, and dimensionality reduction using PCA. Additionally, a Streamlit web app is provided for interactive exploration of the dataset and visualization of the analysis results.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/shivam-nath-10003/Wheat-Kernel-Analysis.git
    ```

2. Run the Streamlit web app:

    ```
    streamlit run Wheat_analysis_streamlit.py
    ```

3. Alternatively, you can explore the analysis and visualization in the Jupyter Notebook:

    ```
    jupyter notebook Seeds.ipynb
    ```

## Project Structure
- `Wheat_analysis_streamlit.py`: Streamlit web app for interactive exploration of the dataset and visualization of analysis results.
- `Seeds.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and visualization code.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project, its requirements, usage instructions, and explanation of the code.

## Features
- **Dataset Exploration**: Visualize scatterplots of different features.
- **Clustering**: Perform K-means clustering on the dataset and visualize the clustering results.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and visualize the results.
- **Streamlit Web App**: Interactive interface for exploring the dataset and visualizing analysis results.

## Credits
- This project is inspired by tutorials and examples from the Python data science community.
